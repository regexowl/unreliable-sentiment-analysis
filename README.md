# Totally Unreliable Sentiment Analysis

üöß **PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS** üöß

My first journey into the wonderful world of sentiment analysis. 
Do not trust this sentiment analysis script under any circumstances! 
The results are most probably as dependable as a dice roll.

## Setup
This project uses twint for Twitter scraping and Natural Language Toolkit for the sentiment analysis part. Specifically the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning) sentiment analysis tools. Pandas module is also needed üêº
